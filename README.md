<h3>Python-based User-defined Techno-economic Optimization and Life Cycle Assessment for e-Hydrogen Production </h3>
</div>

---

## üìëOverview
The **e-Hydrogen Cost Optimizer** application integrates techno-economic optimization and life cycle assessment (LCA) for the production of electrolytic hydrogen (e-hydrogen) powered by renewable energy sources.

The **e-Hydrogen Cost Optimizer** app is built on top of the [Brightway LCA](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/) framework as well as the [optimization modeling framework Pyomo](https://www.pyomo.org/). 

---

## ‚úèCapabilities
 Its capabilities include:
 ### üîß Techno-Economic Modeling and Optimization
- **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** for cost-optimal system design, based on the lowest **Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH)**.
- Optimization of energy systems comprising:
  - Solar photovoltaics (PV)
  - Wind turbines
  - Battery storage systems
  - Electrolyzers
  - Hydrogen storage tanks
- Customizable project parameters, such as hydrogen demand (daily or yearly), location coordinates, component capital and operational expenditure, system lifetime, etc.
- Scenario-based optimization with selectable technology options for each component.
- Graphical interface to run optimizations and view solver status in real time.

### üå± Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
- Built-in integration with the [Brightway2](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/) LCA framework.
- Calculation of climate impact using standard LCIA methods (e.g., Global Warming Potential).
- Component-level environmental performance analysis.
- Exportable CSV file with detailed LCA results per subcomponent.

### üìâ Output and Results
- Export of comprehensive results to `.xlsx` and `.csv` files for further analysis.
- Includes optimized capacities, energy flows, hydrogen production, storage states,  cost metric, environmental performance per subcomponent, etc.
- Results are organized for easy interpretation and reuse.

## üíø How To Install
Follow these steps to install and run the **e-Hydrogen Cost Optimizer** on a Windows system:

### System Requirements
- Operating System: **Windows 10 or higher**
- Internet connection (required for downloading weather data and LCA background data)
- No Python installation required ‚Äî the app runs as a standalone executable (`.exe`) alongside with an `_internal` folder that contains all the resources required.

### üì• Installation Steps

1. **Download the Application**
   - Get the latest version from the official source:

     [Download e_Hydrogen_Cost_Optimizer_v_0_3_1.zip](https://kaust-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/vazqueh_kaust_edu_sa/EcV8zr_Tum1MrNZYRoj2_K8Bh4IKeMUboWhOfY0hlEhFdA?e=ODEOMl)

2. **Extract the Archive**
   - Right-click on the downloaded `.zip` file and select **‚ÄúExtract All...‚Äù**
   - This will create a folder named `e_Hydrogen_Cost_Optimizer_v_0_3_1`

3. **Run the Application**
   - Open the extracted folder and double-click the file:
     ```
     e_Hydrogen_Cost_Optimizer_v_0_3_1.exe
     ```

   - **‚ö† Important:** Do **not** move the `.exe` file out of its folder. If you need to relocate the application, move the entire folder to a new location.
   - You may optionally create a shortcut to the `.exe` file on your desktop.

4. **Uninstallation**
   - To uninstall the application, simply delete the folder `e_Hydrogen_Cost_Optimizer_v_0_3_1`.

## üìò User Manual
A complete **User Manual** is included to guide you through each feature of the application.

It provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for:

- Setting system parameters and selecting technologies
- Running techno-economic optimization
- Interpreting cost results and decision variables
- Exploring time series of system operation
- Performing environmental impact assessments using LCA
- Exporting and analyzing results
- Replicating real-world case studies

You can find the User Manual in the main folder named `User_Manual_v.0.3.1.pdf` file, you can just click [here](User_Manual_v.0.3.1.pdf) to be redirected.

**We highly recommend reviewing the manual before starting a new project.** It is especially useful for first-time users and those working with custom scenarios or advanced inputs.
